        <div class="content-div">
            <p>When browsing through job listings, it can be difficult to understand what recruiters are asking for and how best to convey
                what you bring to the table. That is why in this section of the page we'll be going over what recruiters really mean when they say:
                "Looking for students with 8 years experience using a program that's only be available for 4 years".

        </div>

        <div class="content-div">
            <p>One way to gain an advantage over others is by having a more clean, professional looking resume to make it easier for the recruiters to review your work
                instead of one that looks messy and busy without any proper formatting. Below are examples of a Good v. Bad resume:

        <dl>
            <dt>"Explain to me what the CIA triad is"</dt>
                <dd>Answer - The CIA triad is a model designed to represent the 3 core elements of Information Security

                </dd>
            <dt>"What is Identity Theft and can you prevent it?"</dt>
                <dd>Answer - Identity Theft is when a victim's information is stolen from them and then used without their knowledge/permission. 
                    While there is no 100% fool-proof way to fully prevent identity theft, various steps can be taken to ensure that there is less of a chance
                    you are a victim like for example: frequently update your passwords, use antivirus and learn how to spot various methods of identity theft
                    such as phishing. (These first 2 items and more can be found<a href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/cybersecurity/25-cybersecurity-job-interview-questions-and-answers/" target="_blank"> here)</a>
                </dd>
            <dt>"Differentiate between viruses and worms"</dt>
                <dd>
                    Answer - Viruses can only replicate when activated by the infected host while worms act on their own by traversing the network independently.
                </dd>
            <dt>"What are your greatest strengths and accomplishments?"</dt>
                <dd>
                    Answer - One of the more popular yet also harder questions when it comes to interviews, this one can actually stump quite a few people when brought up
                    on the spot. This is why preparing ahead of time by coming up with a list of your accomplishments can help lessen the anxiety of the interview.
                    It's also important to understand that recruiters are not simply looking for a list of achievments, they're looking at how you reflect on your past works.
                    Lastly is to understand why these accomplishments are relevant to the position you're interviewing for.
