                            Answer - One of the more popular yet also harder questions when it comes to interviews, this one can actually stump quite a few people when brought up
                            on the spot. This is why preparing ahead of time by coming up with a list of your accomplishments can help lessen the anxiety of the interview.
                            It's also important to understand that recruiters are not simply looking for a list of achievments, they're looking at how you reflect on your past works.
                            Lastly is to understand why these accomplishments are relevant to the position you're interviewing for.
